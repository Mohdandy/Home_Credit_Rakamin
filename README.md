# Home_Credit_Rakamin

## Objectives :  ## 
This Project aims to create a machine learning model to predict customers who are able to make repayment are not rejected when applying for a loan, and loans are provided with a principal, maturity and repayment calendar that will motivate customers to succeed.

## Methodology :  ##
- Data Preparation with dataset obtained from the Home Credit Data Scientist Virtual Internship Program at Rakamin Academy.
- Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis to ensure high-quality inputs for the model.
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis to discover patterns, spot anomalies, and gain a deeper understanding of the data's characteristics. with techniques: Visualization, summary statistics, and correlation analysis to identify significant features.
- Perform Machine Learning Modeling with approach by creating predictions will try to use 2 models, namely Logistic Regression and KNN , where these models will be compared and the one that has the best results will be selected. Then it will also be evaluated with Precision, Recall, Accuracy score and F1 score. 

## Tools :  ##
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn

## Results :  ##
The analysis revealed that the KNN model, with an precision of 77%, was the most effective in predicting clients' repayment capabilities.
