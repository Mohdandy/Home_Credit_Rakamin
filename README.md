# Home_Credit_Rakamin

Objectives
This Project aims to create a machine learning model to predict customers who are able to make repayment are not rejected when applying for a loan, and loans are provided with a principal, maturity and repayment calendar that will motivate customers to succeed.

Identifying characteristics of clients who face difficulties in repaying loans.
Developing a predictive model to accurately assess clients' repayment abilities.

Methodology
Data Preparation
Source: Data obtained from the Home Credit Data Scientist Virtual Internship Program at Rakamin Academy.
Actions: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis to ensure high-quality inputs for the model.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Purpose: To discover patterns, spot anomalies, and gain a deeper understanding of the data's characteristics.
Techniques: Visualization, summary statistics, and correlation analysis to identify significant features.
Machine Learning
Goal: Build models to predict clients' repayment capabilities.
Approach: Predictions will try to use 2 models, namely Logistic Regression and KNN , where these models will be compared and the one that has the best results will be selected. Then it will also be evaluated with Precision, Recall, Accuracy score and F1 score. 
Tools
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn
Results
The analysis revealed that the Random Forest model, with an accuracy of 79%, was the most effective in predicting clients' repayment capabilities. This model enables precise and reliable decision-making, ensuring that creditworthy clients are approved and provided with suitable loan terms, ultimately empowering them for successful repayment and financial stability.
